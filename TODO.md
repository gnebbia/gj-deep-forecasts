* Implement user Ids as category with a:
```python
  df_complete["user_id_1_code"] = df_complete["user_id_1"].cat.codes
  df_complete["user_id_2_code"] = df_complete["user_id_2"].cat.codes
```
* Look at the example of the Iris dataset for dataset loading
* work on the jupyter notebook for the training of the model
* make the LDA model parameterized with number of topics and choice of
  text/description
