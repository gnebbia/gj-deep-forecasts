The question is In determining whether a country is an electoral democracy Freedom House examines several key factors concerning the last major national election or elections. To qualify as an electoral democracy a state must have satisfied the following criteria: A competitive multiparty political system Universal adult suffrage for all citizens with exceptions for restrictions that states may legitimately place on citizens as sanctions for criminal offenses Regularly contested elections conducted in conditions of ballot secrecy reasonable ballot security and in the absence of massive voter fraud and that yield results that are representative of the public Significant public access of major political parties to the electorate through the media and through generally open political campaigning. Freedom House term "electoral democracy" differs from "liberal democracy" in that the latter also implies the presence of a substantial array of civil liberties. In the survey all Free countries qualify as both electoral and liberal democracies. By contrast some Partly Free countries qualify as electoral but not liberal democracies. See for more information. Freedom House reports this number in its annual Freedom in the World report and in a separate factsheet made available on its web site. For the 2013 edition see The outcome be resolved upon release of the 2014 edition expected in mid-January 2014. If fractional figures are reported 61.3 percent they be rounded to the nearest whole number.

The question is "The Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons is the implementing body of the Chemical Weapons Convention CWC which entered into force in 1997." On 14 September the US and Russia announced a framework for elimination of Syrian chemical weapons CW that calls for the OPCW to complete initial on-site inspections of declared CW sites by November and that commits both countries to work together for prompt adoption of a UNSC resolution reinforcing a decision of the OPCW Executive Council concerning the process for destroying Syria CW and verification thereof Initial on-site inspections shall be defined to include inspections of all CW sites that Syria declares to the OPCW unless the OPCW officially announces a more limited list of sites for the "initial" round of inspections before December 1st. For purposes of this question only inspections officially authorized by the OPCW count but those inspections may be conducted by UN inspectors contractors or OPCW employees. Inspections that occurred prior to the launch date of this question count toward a "yes" resolution only if the OPCW explicitly states that it is relying on those inspections as part of its own review of Syrian CW sites. A "yes" resolution for the main question requires that the completion of initial on-site inspections of Syria declared CW sites must be officially announced in the media. An official announcement is one made by a spokesperson for the OPCW. "Official" would be evidenced by a press conference press release or other publicly disseminated communique posted to the OPCW web site Regardless of the person or entity making the announcement the announcement must come from someone authorized to speak on behalf of the OPCW who is in fact making the announcement in a public and official capacity.

This policy was established in the 1970s barely but significantly violated a few times in the late 1980s and has been followed ever since. At present however tensions with China appear to be creating upward pressure on Japan defense spending see The initial draft budget for fiscal year 2014 is expected to be published in January 2014 by Japan Ministry of Finance.

Bombings and suicide attacks carried out on the ground count toward a "yes" resolution but surface-to-air attacks rockets hitting an Israeli aircraft not count. Israeli territory refers to any land that lies within Israel official borders including the occupied territories and Israeli settlements as well as Israeli embassies abroad.
